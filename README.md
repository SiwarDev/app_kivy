# app_kivy
I create a small application using Kivy . 
Kivy is a free and open source Python framework for developing mobile apps and other multitouch application software with a natural user interface.
You can enter the Name of the student, his marks and his gender too and you have "Click me" button to save student's informations 
in the back-end of the app.
